    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Curlylint v0.13.0 is out. It’s a relatively minor release, but comes with a few nice-to-haves for users, and a lot of behind-the-scenes project changes.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="modern-python-support">Modern Python support</h2>

<p>Curlylint now officially supports Python 3.9, and (tentatively) Python 3.10, based on the 6th alpha release. From now on, you can expect support for all Python versions <a href="https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches">actively supported by CPython maintainers</a>. In the future, this will also mean actively removing support for Python versions that reach their scheduled end-of-life.</p>

<h2 id="removed-extras-for-development-dependencies">Removed extras for development dependencies</h2>

<p>Python packaging is very messy. I’ve recently started using the <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> package manager at work, primarily for the benefit of having lockfiles to pin transitive dependencies on application-style projects (a must, in my opinion). Here is an excerpt of what installing curlylint looks like in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">poetry.lock</code>:</p>

<div class="language-ini highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">[[package]</span><span class="err">]</span>
<span class="py">name</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">"curlylint"</span>
<span class="py">version</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">"0.12.2"</span>
<span class="py">description</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">" Experimental HTML templates linting for Jinja, Nunjucks, Django templates, Twig, Liquid"</span>
<span class="py">category</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">"main"</span>
<span class="py">optional</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">false</span>
<span class="py">python-versions</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">"&gt;=3.6"</span>

<span class="nn">[package.dependencies]</span>
<span class="py">attrs</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">"&gt;=17.2.0"</span>
<span class="py">click</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">"&gt;=6.5"</span>
<span class="py">dataclasses</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">{version = "&gt;=0.6", markers = "python_version &lt; </span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="s">3.7</span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="s">"}
parsy = "1.1.0"</span>
<span class="py">pathspec</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">"&gt;=0.6,&lt;1"</span>
<span class="py">toml</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">"&gt;=0.9.4"</span>

<span class="nn">[package.extras]</span>
<span class="py">dev</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">["black (==19.10b0)", "flake8 (==3.8.4)", "mypy (==0.812)", "pytest (==6.2.2)", "coverage (==5.4)"]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I find this last line very puzzling – there really should be no need for dependencies intended only for development to be visible in the published package. I don’t want curlylint’s development dependencies changing from release to release to cause noise in upgrade diffs, hence why the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dev</code> extra has been removed.</p>

<p>It’s worth saying Poetry has otherwise been a pleasure to work with, with only a few minor inconveniences like this one. I would happily recommend it to people wanting more out of their Python package management.</p>

<h2 id="new---template-tags-cli-flag">New <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--template-tags</code> CLI flag</h2>

<p>As the <a href="https://www.curlylint.org/docs/command-line-usage#--template-tags"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--template-tags</code> documentation</a> now states, this makes Curlylint aware of custom tags used in templates, so the parser can understand they contain HTML content to go through.</p>

<p>This option was previously only available via a TOML configuration file, via the (now deprecated) <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jinja-custom-elements-names</code> / <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jinja_custom_elements_names</code> setting. The new setting works the same, but can also be set via CLI flags.</p>

<h2 id="behind-the-scenes-changes">Behind-the-scenes changes</h2>

<p>There really is only one I want to highlight – improvements to Curlylint’s test suite, which have resulted in a <a href="https://coveralls.io/github/thibaudcolas/curlylint?branch=main">14% increase in test coverage</a>. While test coverage percentages generally don’t mean much, in this case this means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The command line interface now has unit tests. While relatively basic in the current iteration, they should be very easy to add to.</li>
  <li>The parser has more unit tests, and they are now in line with the rest of the test suite.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://coveralls.io/github/thibaudcolas/curlylint"><img src="/images/blog/curlylint-quality-of-life-improvements/coverage-over-time.png" alt="Screen capture of the Coveralls coverage score over time as an area chart, from 59% in early March to 74% now" /></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://coveralls.io/">Coveralls</a> shows coverage increasing from 59.39% in early March to 74% in late April.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having comprehensive unit tests really matters to me as a maintainer, and from now on it should be much more realistic to expect all changes to the project to come with corresponding unit tests.</p>

<h2 id="up-next">Up next</h2>

<p>There are a lot of <a href="https://github.com/thibaudcolas/curlylint/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Aparser">parser bugs</a> I will now feel much more comfortable approaching, due to having a way to easily write tests for them.</p>

<p>Short-term, I want to make sure to get to all of the open pull request, hopefully fully clearing the backlog. I can see people are responding very well to Curlylint despite its experimental nature, and are eager to help making it more useful:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/thibaudcolas/curlylint/pull/53">#53 Optional HTML container parsing for if-else-endif type code</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/thibaudcolas/curlylint/pull/75">#75 Add test for unresolved missing alt attribute inside django block (#72)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/thibaudcolas/curlylint/pull/76">#76 Use types_or directive for hook instead of files</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For me, the most immediate next step will be presenting Curlylint at <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2021/">PyCon US 2021</a>! I hope to get critical feedback on the tool, and am also working on an “online playground” version to try lint templates without installing anything, we should make it simpler for people to try out the linter.</p>

    <link href="https://thib.me/wagtail-accessibility-team-reloaded"/>
    <updated>2021-02-24T07:42:03+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://thib.me/wagtail-accessibility-team-reloaded</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="https://wagtail.io/blog/announcing-wagtail-sub-teams/">6 months of operations</a>, we reflect on the progress our <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Wagtail-sub-teams#accessibility">accessibility team</a> has made, and go on the lookout for new contributors.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="progress-to-date">Progress to date</h2>

<p>Early on, <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Accessibility-team#2020-07-17">we chose</a> to give priority to improvements we could make to sites built with Wagtail, rather than the Wagtail admin. Practically, this meant:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Putting together <a href="https://docs.wagtail.io/en/latest/advanced_topics/accessibility_considerations.html">Wagtail’s accessibility considerations documentation</a>, as most of the accessibility issues we identified were either dependent on how Wagtail is used, or could be worked around by implementers.</li>
  <li>From this list, we also created a <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/projects/10">backlog of known accessibility issues</a>, which we would then proceed to fixing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Along the way, we also kept working on the <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/6107">SVG icons</a> refactoring for the admin, bit by bit.</p>

<h2 id="team-operations">Team operations</h2>

<p>We ran a short <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Accessibility-team#2021-01-22----team-retrospective">retrospective</a> to reflect on the team’s way of working over the last 6 months.</p>

<ul>
  <li>There were a total of 5 people involved at some point over the 6 months (Scott, Andreas, Nick, Helen, and Thibaud), but only 2 people attended each meeting on average. Not as much as we’d ideally want to.</li>
  <li>We met 9 times, for 30min each, scheduled once every two weeks.</li>
  <li>Overall we’re happy with what we’ve achieved and how the team works.</li>
  <li>We were keen to do more automated tests and manual auditing but didn’t get around to it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-future">The future</h2>

<p>There are a few changes we will want to see over the next 6-month tenure of the team.</p>

<p><strong>We’ll want to do a new, comprehensive accessibility audit of Wagtail</strong>, either for WCAG 2.2 AA or ATAG 2.0. We want to have a clear, public record of how we’re doing.</p>

<p>We’ll review our contribution guidelines <strong>so accessibility is part and parcel of making changes to Wagtail</strong>.</p>

<p>And we’ll also investigate having <strong>automated accessibility tests built into Wagtail</strong>. <a href="https://github.com/neon-jungle/wagtail-accessibility">wagtail-accessibility</a> is one of the most popular third-party packages out there, and we want to double down on having this be one of Wagtail’s strengths.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="we-also-want-to-involve-more-people">We also want to involve more people</h3>

<p>There’s only so much we can do with two to three of us actively involved – ideally we’d want a team twice that size! All are welcome regardless of skill level or background, and the time commitment is very reasonable. We’re particularly keen to work with people who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have personal experience of access and functional needs, or who are regular users of assistive technologies.</li>
  <li>Work on User Experience, design, or content – and can help us understand the needs of our users.</li>
</ul>

<p>And of course web developers who want to have a practical impact on making the web more accessible!</p>

<p>Does this sound like your kind of jam? If you’re keen to learn more, <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack">reach out to us on Slack</a> in #accessibility.</p>

    <link href="https://thib.me/atag-getting-started-resources"/>
    <updated>2021-01-06T21:42:03+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://thib.me/atag-getting-started-resources</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There aren’t many resources out there about <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">ATAG</a>. Here are the ones I have found and occasionally come back to.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="why-do-we-need-this">Why do we need this?</h2>

<p>I often hear people question whether ATAG really is applicable to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;insert name of tool&gt;</code>. In my experience the answer has so far always been “yes”. Here’s a quick step by step:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Does the tool allow creating content for the web? (any editing of content visible on a website)</li>
  <li>That content needs to be accessible.</li>
  <li>So the tool needs to make it possible to create accessible content.</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s as simple as that, regardless of whether the “tool” is a CMS, a text editor, an admin panel, or just a form with a few plain-text fields.</p>

<p>Mitchell Evan also summarizes the need for ATAG in his excellent talk <a href="https://wpaccessibilityday.org/talks/if-its-true-it-aint-bragging-choosing-a-cms-for-accessibility/">If it’s true it ain’t bragging! Choosing a CMS for accessibility</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG): Who needs them?</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Nobody — because no law or regulation directly requires ATAG.</li>
    <li><strong>Everybody — because ATAG reduces your risk of an inaccessible website.</strong></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So – yes, there is no compliance requirement. But it’s no less relevant of a standard, and it is the de-facto goalpost for all authoring tools who care about accessibility out there. Oh and it will likely <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/wcag3-intro/">be part of WCAG 3.0</a>, which will likely be a compliance requirement in the future.</p>

<h2 id="official-resources">Official resources</h2>

<p>There are very few unfortunately.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/atag/report-tool/">ATAG report tool</a> is the official ATAG report generator.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/w3c/wai-authoring-tools">WAI Authoring Tools</a> is a very promising way to explore how different tools comply with ATAG, unfortunately the project seems to have stalled halfway through.
    <ul>
      <li>In particular, this project has a list of <a href="https://wai-authoring-tools.netlify.app/authoring-tools/selecting#features">accessibility features in authoring tools</a> which makes for a very good introduction to ATAG.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/projects/wai-guide/">WAI Guide</a> is a W3C project co-funded by the EU’s Horizon 2020 program, that might produce more resources in the future.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>

<p>There are a few research teams working on authoring tools’ accessibility. Here is the work that stood out the most for me.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://accessibilitycluster.com/">Accessibility Cluster</a> is another EU research project currently under way to look at accessibility in CMSes. There are interesting resources available from the project pilot, unfortunately doesn’t go very far beyond what ATAG already states:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.funka.com/en/projekt/we4authors/we4authors-main-activities-and-results/workshops-on-accessible-content-management-systems/workshops/">Workshops results</a></li>

      <li>Report for CMS tools in particular (but could apply to any kind of web publishing): <a href="https://www.funka.com/contentassets/c43f6521e7354c9a8f82e62402f10aad/guidelines_for_authoring_tools_producers.pdf">Guidelines for authoring tools producers</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tania_Acosta4/publication/322250312_Method_for_Accessibility_Assessment_of_Online_Content_Editors/links/5d6600faa6fdccc32cd67dbd/Method-for-Accessibility-Assessment-of-Online-Content-Editors.pdf">Method for accessibility assessment of online content editors (preprint)</a> covers which WCAG guidelines should likely be considered when evaluating ATAG for a CMS.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="drupal-and-wordpress">Drupal and WordPress</h2>

<p>In the CMS world, Drupal and WordPress have the most established resources when it comes to accessibility, and ATAG in particular.</p>

<p>Drupal:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/accessibility">Accessibility in Drupal</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2034909">Drupal - Track progress in ATAG 2.0 conformance</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Out of date but still interesting: <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/164389">Drupal compliance overview of ATAG 2.0</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://medium.com/@mgifford/web-accessibility-atag-drupal-8-4132bf3724ea">Web Accessibility, ATAG &amp; Drupal 8</a></li>

</ul>

<p>WordPress:</p>

<ul>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://wpaccessibilityday.org/talks/your-cms-is-an-accessibility-assistant/">Your CMS is an Accessibility Assistant</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/V0yJ_qJBvoc?t=7775">video</a></li>

  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.wpcampus.org/blog/2019/05/gutenberg-audit-results/">WPCampus releases results of the Gutenberg accessibility audit</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other-platforms">Other platforms</h2>

<p>There are a few other authoring tools that have some accessibility / ATAG-relevant resources:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.wix.com/accessibility">Wix accessibility tools &amp; guides</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/Accessibility-at-SurveyMonkey">Accessibility at SurveyMonkey</a></li>
  <li>One I put together for Wagtail: <a href="https://docs.wagtail.io/en/latest/advanced_topics/accessibility_considerations.html">Wagtail accessibility considerations</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="atag-examples">ATAG examples</h2>

<p>To round off this list, here are practical examples of checkers that can help meet ATAG’s Principle B.3: Authors are supported in improving the accessibility of existing content.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/plugins/premium/a11ychecker/">TinyMCE’s accessibility checker</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://khan.github.io/tota11y/">Tota11y</a>, particularly relevant for content management systems.

We’re big fans at Torchbox, but Pattern Lab is PHP or Node-based, while we decided long ago to <a href="https://torchbox.com/blog/alternatives-to-drupal/">leave the PHP / Drupal world behind</a>, and concentrate on Django.

<h2 id="pattern-libraries-at-torchbox">Pattern libraries at Torchbox</h2>

<p>At Torchbox, pattern libraries are a way to separate concerns between front-end and back-end development. We’ve been using our Django pattern library package for a couple of years to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clarify responsibilities and separate concerns, both in code, and as members of a development team between front-end and back-end development.</li>
  <li>As needed, enable for front-end developers to work on pages and block templates before any back-end development happens.</li>
  <li>Encourage code reuse and components composition – defining independent UI components, reusable without markup copy-paste, and reusable on other projects like any Django app.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does this sound useful to you? Go and have a look at our introductory presentation from Wagtail Space US 2020, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isrOufI7TKc">Reusable UI components – A journey from React to Wagtail</a>:</p>

<h2 id="our-first-big-release">Our first big release</h2>

<p>Pattern Lab has been around for a while, and so has our own <a href="https://torchbox.github.io/django-pattern-library/">django-pattern-library</a>, but we only open-sourced it a few months ago. Sadly it wasn’t as well documented or flexible as we would have liked it to be. This is starting to change with our most recent release. Here are the headline features:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://torchbox.github.io/django-pattern-library/getting-started/#compatibility">Support for Python 3.9, Django 3.0, 3.1, and tentatively 3.2</a>. We also started running the project’s tests against Django’s development branch for good measure.</li>
  <li>A new <a href="https://torchbox.github.io/django-pattern-library/guides/automated-tests/#with-render_patterns"><em>render_patterns</em> management command</a>, so you can test whether all of your project’s patterns render successfully at once. Think of it as smoke tests for pattern library components.</li>
  <li><a href="https://torchbox.github.io/django-pattern-library/reference/api/#override_tag">Optional default values for tag overrides</a>, so you no longer have to repeat specific overrides in all of your component mocks.</li>
  <li><a href="https://torchbox.github.io/django-pattern-library/reference/api/#sections">Support for arbitrary template structures</a> – whether that’s across multiple apps or only one, however you want your templates to be structured.</li>
</ul>

<p>View the full <a href="https://github.com/torchbox/django-pattern-library/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG</a>. Along those shiny features, we also released two massive improvements to the project: a <a href="https://torchbox.github.io/django-pattern-library/">new documentation website</a>, with lots more content – guides, recipes, and reference info. And also a <a href="https://torchbox.github.io/django-pattern-library/demo/pattern-library/">new demo site</a>, so you can see for yourself how the project works (although note the public demo is <a href="https://torchbox.github.io/django-pattern-library/guides/static-site-export/">exported as a static site</a>).</p>

<h3 id="template-structures">Template structures</h3>

<p>Starting in v0.3.0, you may structure your project’s templates in however many folders you want. This feels like such an obvious need in hindsight, but the pattern library having only been an internal Torchbox project for a while, it didn’t really need to accommodate that many different structures!</p>

<p>This is now possible thanks to the new <a href="https://torchbox.github.io/django-pattern-library/reference/api/#sections">SECTIONS</a> setting, with the previous predefined structure kept as the default for backwards compatibility. It also comes with a lot of black magic to decide which templates are partials and should be rendered in a base template, and which can be rendered as-is.</p>

<h3 id="render_patterns">render_patterns</h3>

<p>This new management command might or might not be relevant to you but it’s worth highlighting use cases this is intended to support:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://torchbox.github.io/django-pattern-library/guides/static-site-export/">Static exports of the pattern library</a>, for those cases where you want a simple way to share patterns publicly or host them alongside documentation, rather than alongside your site.</li>
  <li><a href="https://torchbox.github.io/django-pattern-library/guides/automated-tests/">Automated tests of UI components</a>, particularly in continuous integration, where it might be problematic for you to get a Django server up and running depending on the project’s dependencies.</li>
</ul>

<p>Combined with tools like <a href="https://pa11y.org/">Pa11y and pa11y-ci</a>, this makes it much simpler to run site-wide automated accessibility tests for all of your project’s templates, making the most of the pattern library’s tightly controlled mock data:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/pattern-lab-goes-django/gitlab-ci-pa11y-patterns.png" alt="Screenshot of pa11y-ci output in GitLab CI showing reported issues on pattern library templates" /></p>

<p>There are still rough edges (for example the command will abort the whole test suite if only a single template fails to render!), but we hope you’ll find uses for this nonetheless.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next</h2>

<p>Hopefully more of the above – new features, more stability, better documentation. We’re particulary keen on <a href="https://github.com/torchbox/django-pattern-library/issues/106">finding ways to mock templates with factories rather than plain data structures</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/torchbox/django-pattern-library/issues/103">combining our Django rendering features with Storybook’s developer experience</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How can you tell if a site is made with Wagtail or not? There are more ways than people might think at first sight, and after a few years of toying with the idea I finally put together a way to detect Wagtail sites, that strikes a good balance between reliability and convenience. Let’s go birdwatching.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="ways-to-detect-wagtail">Ways to detect Wagtail</h2>

<p>I could think of a few <a href="https://github.com/springload/madewithwagtail/issues/62">when I first started thinking of this problem</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Determine if the site is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/721934/how-can-you-tell-if-a-site-has-been-made-with-django">built with Django</a>. That’s a start</li>
  <li>Check if the site uses a <a href="https://wagtail.io/wagtail-badges/">Wagtail badge</a>. Cute, but not used much in practice.</li>
  <li>Load <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/admin/login</code> and check for “wagtail” in the response – that would surely be an almost certain match.</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem with a lot of those approaches is their relance on crawling the site, which is quite invasive, not very reliable, and can be time-consuming across a lot of sites. It’s also unclear how common those cues would be across the breadth of Wagtail sites out there.</p>

<p>The ideal approach would be HTTP response headers – which could be obtained from any page with a lightweight HEAD request. Wagtail unfortunately doesn’t have any custom header, so the next best thing is to inspect the pages’ markup:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wagtail’s (legacy) rich text uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rich-text</code> class to wrap the HTML of rich text fields</li>
  <li>Rich text images use hard-coded classes like <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/blob/bb2e460c0b92fba802fc3f369730004d6b648e64/wagtail/images/formats.py#L91-L94"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">richtext-image full-width</code></a></li>
  <li>Wagtail’s documents are served from a <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/blob/bb2e460c0b92fba802fc3f369730004d6b648e64/wagtail/documents/urls.py#L6"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/documents/</code></a> sub-path.</li>
  <li>And last but not least, <a href="https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/topics/images.html?highlight=renditions#generating-image-renditions-in-python">image renditions</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Image renditions are very common on Wagtail sites. The detection would only work for pages that have user-uploaded images, but lucky for us a site’s homepage tends to be the type of high-value page where there are CMS-managed images. Here are a few examples of URLs from renditions:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">https://www.jazzfestival.nz/media/images/video-fallback-image_1.width-1920.png

/media/images/bevi_3_mob.original.format-png.png

/media/original_images/Social_Distancing_Dashboard_-_image_1_TU_DelftAMS_Institute.png

https://buckup-ff-stories.s3.amazonaws.com/original_images/Lockup_Logo_-_JPEG-1.png

/media/images/UE4LowPolyVehicleTh.2e16d0ba.fill-960x540-c0.jpg
</code></pre>

<p>The distinctive features are the folders – always either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">images</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">original_images</code>, and frequently either placed directly at the root of a site, or from a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/media</code> subfolder at the root, or a single level up. And then the fact that all of the site’s images are placed in those two folders without any additional sub-folders, with file name suffixes following a set format for all files under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">images/</code> like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.width-1920</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.fill-960x450-c0</code> above. I came up with the particular regex used here after trying out different variations on 800’000 homepages from the <a href="https://majestic.com/reports/majestic-million">Majestic Million</a> list of domains.</p>

<h2 id="the-regex">The regex</h2>

<p>Here is a simplified diagram of the logic (created with <a href="https://regexper.com/#%5C%2F%28original_images%5C%2F%5B%5Cw-%5D%2B%5C.%7Cimages%5C%2F%5B%5Cw-.%5D%2B%5C.%28%28fill%7Cmax%7Cmin%7Cwidth%7Cheight%7Cscale%29-%5Cd%7Coriginal%29%29">regexper</a>):</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/detecting-wagtail-in-the-wild/regexper-diagram.svg" alt="regexper train diagram of Wagtail regular expressions" /></p>

<h2 id="real-world-usage">Real-world usage</h2>

<p>The regex could be more complex and precise but this wouldn’t actually change much to its real-world usefulness, so I gradually simplified it to the above. With this in place, we can then create different ways to run this detection on arbitrary websites:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An online website, <a href="https://detect-wagtail.netlify.app/">detect-wagtail.netlify.app</a>.</li>
  <li>A bookmarket, also available from <a href="https://detect-wagtail.netlify.app/">detect-wagtail.netlify.app</a>.</li>
  <li>A browser extension thanks to <a href="https://github.com/AliasIO/wappalyzer">Wappalyzer</a>.</li>
  <li>A Node CLI, also thanks to <a href="https://github.com/AliasIO/wappalyzer">Wappalyzer</a>.</li>
  <li>As an npm package for more custom needs, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/detect-wagtail">detect-wagtail</a></li>
</ul>

<p>With Wappalyzer in particular, they also offer additional services based on anonymous data reporting from their detection tools. Here is their page that aggregates Wagtail usage data: <a href="https://www.wappalyzer.com/technologies/cms/wagtail/">Websites using Wagtail</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re unsure which of these to use – the Wappalyzer checks are the strictest, so best used if you don’t want to manually confirm the results by inspecting the pages’ HTML.</p>

<h2 id="real-world-data">Real-world data</h2>

<p>With this regex in place, I tried it out on a few lists of websites. See <a href="https://github.com/thibaudcolas/detect-wagtail/tree/main/docs/analysis">detect-wagtail/docs/analysis</a> for the full details.</p>

<h3 id="eu-public-sector-websites">EU public sector websites</h3>

<p>Dataset from <a href="https://www.funka.com/en/projekt/we4authors/">We4authors</a>. Based on this analysis, I could find 3 national EU public sector websites built with Wagtail:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">www.danepubliczne.gov.pl
www.nhs.uk
www.nesta.org.uk
</code></pre>

<p>There are many more public sector websites built with Wagtail at the national and regional / local level, but this type of analysis already shows the value in having the ability to detect Wagtail – the CMS could be part of <a href="https://www.funka.com/en/projekt/we4authors/we4authors-main-activities-and-results/market-analysis-and-benchmarking-process-of-existing-cms/">market analysis</a> for research projects like We4authors, from which we can learn a lot.</p>

<h3 id="us-federal-websites">US federal websites</h3>

<p>Analysis of the US federal websites from the <a href="https://github.com/GSA/digitalgov.gov/blob/main/content/resources/content-management-systems-used-by-government-agencies.md">digital.gov list</a>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">fec.gov
www.peacecorps.gov
www.consumerfinance.gov
</code></pre>

<h3 id="made-with-wagtail">Made with Wagtail</h3>

<p><a href="https://madewithwagtail.org/">Made with Wagtail</a> is a showcase of a lot of Wagtail sites and apps. About two thirds of sites listed are detected with the following regular expressions.</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ag <span class="s1">'\/(original_images\/[\w-]+\.|images\/[\w-.]+\.((fill|max|min|width|height|scale)-\d|original))'</span> mww <span class="nt">--stats-only</span>
<span class="c"># 382 files contained matches</span>
ag <span class="s1">'\/media\/(original_images\/[\w-]+\.|images\/[\w-.]+\.((fill|max|min)-\d+x\d+(-c\d+)?|(width|height|scale)-\d+|original)\.)'</span> mww <span class="nt">--stats-only</span>
<span class="c"># 292 files contained matches</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The remaining third are largely made up of sites that… actually aren’t made with Wagtail, either because Wagtail is only used for a specific section of a site (and not the homepage), or because the site got rebuilt with another technology since being listed there.</p>

<h3 id="majestic-million">Majestic Million</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://majestic.com/reports/majestic-million">Majestic Million</a> is a dataset of 1M domain names ordered by popularity. We can also use the above methodology to assess how many websites are made with Wagtail on this list (about 0.05%).</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ag <span class="s1">'\/media\/(original_images\/[\w-]+\.|images\/[\w-.]+\.((fill|max|min)-\d+x\d+(-c\d+)?|(width|height|scale)-\d+|original)\.)'</span> million <span class="nt">--stats-only</span>
<span class="c"># 296 files contained matches</span>
ag <span class="s1">'\/(original_images\/[\w-]+\.|images\/[\w-.]+\.((fill|max|min|width|height|scale)-\d|original))'</span> ../detect-wagtail-data/million <span class="nt">--stats-only</span>
<span class="c"># 528 files contained matches</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Those numbers neatly match those of <a href="https://whatcms.org/c/Wagtail">WhatCMS</a>.</p>

<h2 id="security-implications">Security implications</h2>

<p>Telling whether a given site is built with Wagtail or not really doesn’t take that much effort. The image renditions methodology also shows it’s very easy to do at scale. There is nothing here that can prevent bad actors from scanning the web for vulnerable Wagtail sites, as is commonplace for other platforms. For all intents and purposes, you should assume this is happening already.</p>

<p>What should we do then? For a start, don’t rely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity">security through obscurity</a>. Take the time to establish a threat model for your site, and protect it accordingly by restricting access to anything exploitable, and implementing brute force protections where relevant. Take a multi-layered approach to security – with defenses at the network level (e.g. a WAF), application level (e.g. rate limiting, defensive programming, handling of untrusted input, etc.), and also monitoring (logs analysis).</p>

<p>An old but still relevant example of this in the Wagtail world is <a href="https://github.com/springload/wagtailenforcer">WagtailEnforcer</a>.</p>

<p>And of course, keep your site up-to-date with security fixes for all its dependencies. While the approach described here doesn’t make it possible to determine which version of Wagtail is used – there are other very viable approaches that make this equally as easy (see <a href="https://github.com/caioariede/detect-django-version">detect-django-version</a> for inspiration).</p>

<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>

<p>There are a lot more applications to being able to detect Wagtail websites than just knowing how many there are out there. <a href="WhatCMS.org">WhatCMS.org</a> has had some amount of Wagtail data for years and is a good example of the potential for market analysis. For me, I’m more interested in seeing how Wagtail is used in the wild. Here are interesting questions this can help answer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wagtail headless usage – which static site generators are the most common with Wagtail, that would be worth documenting the usage of better. In my analysis, I found a lot of Next and Gatsby websites in particular.</li>
  <li>Security best practices – how many websites have the Wagtail admin accessible from any IP vs being restricted.</li>
  <li>Accessibility – how accessible Wagtail sites are.</li>
</ul>

<p>This last point is the one I’m the most interested in – in particular, comparing Wagtail’s results to those of other technologies in the <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/">WebAIM Million</a>. We’ll see how that goes!</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="the-requirements-of-ci">The requirements of CI</h2>

<p>It’s worth pointing out early – no accessibility testing tool can <a href="https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-tool-audit/">find all issues</a> . With this in mind, in CI, we need to focus on tools that find as much as possible… but don’t create false positives, which are very damaging when they fail your build. It’s more important for a tool to have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall">high precision, than a high recall</a>).</p>

<h2 id="static-analysis">Static analysis</h2>

<p>This is always a valuable first line of defense.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Basic checks for stylesheets: <a href="https://github.com/YozhikM/stylelint-a11y">stylelint-a11y</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>Relatively advanced checks for React code: <a href="https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react">eslint-plugin-react</a>, <a href="https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y">eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y</a></li>
  <li>And a Vue equivalent: <a href="https://github.com/maranran/eslint-plugin-vue-a11y">eslint-plugin-vue-a11y</a></li>
  <li>For HTML templates, you can try my own experimental HTML templates linter, <a href="https://github.com/thibaudcolas/curlylint">Curlylint</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="accessibility-tests-in-unit-and-integration-tests">Accessibility tests in unit and integration tests</h2>

<p>Here are the options, from simplest to most complex:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/nickcolley/jest-axe">jest-axe</a> in jsdom for React projects. It’s very lightweight to set up, and gives surprisingly good results.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/nickcolley/jest-axe">jest-axe</a> in Puppeteer. It’s not lightweight to set up, far from it, but does a bit more.</li>
  <li><a href="https://pa11y.org/">Pa11y</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y-ci">pa11y-ci</a>. Not lightweight either, but simple to configure.</li>
  <li>Google’s Lighthouse also has a <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci">Lighthouse CI</a> variant which may be useful when also wanting to have performance and best practice checks.</li>
  <li>An alternative could also be to run HTML validation with <a href="https://validator.github.io/validator/">V.Nu HTML5 validator</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-to-test">What to test</h2>

<p>It’s not always easy to have test content to run the checks against of in CI. My personal preference is to run the tests against a pattern library’s components, for example <a href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a> or <a href="https://github.com/torchbox/django-pattern-library">django-pattern-library</a>. As part of creating the components, we naturally create test data for them similarly to unit tests (TDD or not) – this test content can then be used to test the components’ variations for accessibility issues.</p>

  <li>Tags often depend on the database (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">include_block foo</code>)</li>
  <li>Visual testing requires time-consuming manual setup</li>
  <li>Django’s native testing tools are inadequate for visual testing - especially cross-browser</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pattern-lab-goes-django">Pattern Lab goes Django!</h3>

<p>pip install django-pattern-library</p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>

<h3 id="known-issues">Known issues</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Documentation is good but could be much better</li>
  <li>Context merging is fragile and requires some repetition in YAML files</li>
  <li>Template tag mocking is not flexible enough</li>
  <li>No support for mocking filters yet</li>
  <li>Richer objects are fiddly to mock (e.g. ``)</li>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Curlylint: Accessibility linting rules]]></title>
    <link href="https://thib.me/curlylint-accessibility-linting-rules"/>
    <updated>2020-07-26T02:22:49+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://thib.me/curlylint-accessibility-linting-rules</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Curlylint now comes with 7 accessibility-related rules, ready to use in HTML templates. See <a href="https://www.curlylint.org/docs/rules/all">All rules</a> for details about the individual rules.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>This is an important milestone for the linter – essentially demonstrating its usefulness once and for all, if that was still needed.</p>

<h2 id="html-best-practices">HTML best practices</h2>

<p>Most of the rules Curlylint currently ships with are very simple “HTML linting” rules for accessibility, based on established best practice:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.curlylint.org/docs/rules/aria_role"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aria_role</code></a> just checks that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">role</code> attributes are valid.</li>
  <li>Same for <a href="https://www.curlylint.org/docs/rules/html_has_lang"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">html_has_lang</code></a>, for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">html</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lang</code> attribute.</li>
  <li>Same for <a href="https://www.curlylint.org/docs/rules/image_alt"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">image_alt</code></a>, <a href="https://www.curlylint.org/docs/rules/meta_viewport"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">meta_viewport</code></a>, <a href="https://www.curlylint.org/docs/rules/no_autofocus"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">no_autofocus</code></a>, <a href="https://www.curlylint.org/docs/rules/tabindex_no_positive"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tabindex_no_positive</code></a>!</li>
</ul>

<p>See a pattern? All of these are variations on the same theme of “HTML attributes should only contain a limited range of values based on established best practices”. This is great news for this project – it means there can be quite a lot of results achieved with minimal complexity when it comes to creating individual rules.</p>

<p>In the future, this could easily be taken further to cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Security best practices, for example <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rel="noopener"</code>, or disallowing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">javascript:</code> URLs in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">href</code>.</li>
  <li>HTML maintainability best practices, for example disallowing duplicate class attributes.</li>
  <li>And of course, more accessibility and ARIA best practices.</li>
</ul>

<p>Obligatory mention of <a href="https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y">eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y</a>, which has been a huge source of inspiration. Generally, modern React tooling has this figured out, with extensive static analysis available. For me, this isn’t just a nice-to-have – it’s hard to always keel all of those best practices in mind, and linting is there to automate this for you. Note this isn’t just React – Vue has its <a href="https://github.com/maranran/eslint-plugin-vue-a11y">eslint-plugin-vue-a11y</a> too!</p>

<h2 id="templates-best-practices">Templates best practices</h2>

<p>This doesn’t have to stop at HTML. Curlylint already supports parsing template syntax, attempting to be usable as a linter for Jinja, Twig, Liquid, <a href="https://www.curlylint.org/docs/template-languages">and the likes</a>. We can also have rules to enforce best practices for this template syntax.</p>

<p>The first example of such a rule is <a href="https://www.curlylint.org/docs/rules/django_forms_rendering"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">django_forms_rendering</code></a>, which restricts how forms can be rendered in Django projects, for accessibility reasons. I’m very excited about opportunities like this to codify and share best practices in a way that scales well.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hopefully there will be more <a href="https://github.com/django/deps/pull/69">linting rules for Django</a> coming in the future.</li>
  <li>And more linting rules <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/6090">for Wagtail</a> as well.</li>
</ul>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Curlylint: Brand new rules documentation]]></title>
    <link href="https://thib.me/curlylint-brand-new-rules-documentation"/>
    <updated>2020-07-18T22:05:21+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://thib.me/curlylint-brand-new-rules-documentation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have I mentioned <a href="/welcome-to-curlylint">how important I think it is for a linter to have great docs</a>? Well, now is the time for Curlylint to live up to this!</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="new-documentation-format-for-rules">New documentation format for rules</h2>

<p>Up until now the rules’ documentation was pretty sad, essentially limited to what could fit in the project’s README. Now… take a look:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.curlylint.org/docs/rules/image_alt"><img src="/images/blog/curlylint-brand-new-rules-documentation/new-rules-docs.png" alt="Screen capture of the image_alt rule’s documentation" /></a></p>

<ul>
  <li>The rule’s different configuration options are clearly visible, copy-pasteable, each with a description.</li>
  <li>Cases where the rule check “succeeds” are well documented, alongside a comment, and matching configuration.</li>
  <li>Same for problematic cases, which even show the actual error message!</li>
  <li>All of this is toggle-able between the different configuration formats supported by Curlylint!</li>
  <li>There are follow-up resources available for developers who want more information about the rule.</li>
</ul>

<p>This feels like a pretty big step up compared to the previous documentation, and should hopefully make it as easy as possible for people to start using the linter for their templates.</p>

<h2 id="how-this-works">How this works</h2>

<p>The majority of the rules’ documentation is generated from their metadata:</p>

<h3 id="json-schema">JSON Schema</h3>

<p>The configuration options are all defined with <a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a>.Currently this is only used to generate the documentation, but in the future I would also like to make this validate configurations as Curlylint runs.</p>

<p>JSON Schema is particularly good for this because it has built-in support for the schema to be self-documenting – adding titles, descriptions, and examples, which are all used to generate the documentation. Here is the schema of the <a href="https://www.curlylint.org/docs/rules/html_has_lang"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">html_has_lang</code></a> rule as an example:</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nl">"oneOf"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
      </span><span class="nl">"const"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
      </span><span class="nl">"title"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"The `lang` attribute must be present."</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
      </span><span class="nl">"examples"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="p">},</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
      </span><span class="nl">"type"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"string"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
      </span><span class="nl">"title"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"The `lang` attribute must match the configured language tag."</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
      </span><span class="nl">"examples"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"en-US"</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="test-cases">Test cases</h3>

<p>The success / fail sections are simply coming from the project’s test suite! I always prefer to invest time writing extensive unit tests for projects of this kind. Some of the test cases simply have a flag marking them as “documentation examples”:</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nl">"label"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Check lang is present"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nl">"template"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"&lt;html lang=</span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="s2">en</span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="s2">&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nl">"example"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nl">"config"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nl">"output"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[]</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s the same story for “fail” cases, where the annotations are simply generated from the expected output (issues):</p>

<p>All of this comes together with <a href="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</a>, a Markdown-inspired syntax which makes it possible to use JSX directly inside documents, thereby making it possible to use React components, like the language tabs and code snippets with annotations:</p>

    <id>https://thib.me/interview-exercises-for-web-developers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are a couple of interview exercises I like to give, which are relatively open to varied approaches.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="before-the-interview-form-validation">Before the interview: Form validation</h2>

<p>I’ve always liked Springload’s <a href="https://github.com/springload/form-validation-problem">form validation problem</a>. It’s a relatively simple problem in apparence – implementing form validation for a basic HTML form, with a few fields, and a few validation rules.</p>

<p>What I think makes it really good is that it’s possible to approach this in many different ways – and there are lots of things for candidates to demonstrate beyond the basic implementation of the form validation – knowledge in any of those areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Documentation</li>
  <li>Accessibility</li>
  <li>Progressive enhancement</li>
  <li>Browser support</li>
  <li>Testing</li>
  <li>Tooling</li>
</ul>

<p>Form validation is a particularly interesting problem in web development because there is a fair amount of state to manage – validation errors for each fields, as well as whether the fields have been interacted with or not to decide when to display the errors.</p>

<p>Candidates can take a shot at this with vanilla JS, a ready-made library like <a href="https://parsleyjs.org/">Parsley</a>, or can be asked to do this with React (Redux Forms, Formik, bespoke?), or even back-end technologies.</p>

<h2 id="at-the-interview-build-this">At the interview: Build This</h2>

<p>This is my go-to “how would you do this” problem, initially encountered at Codemate, which can be used to interview full-stack developers (any stack), or front-end or back-end only. The candidate is shown a specific UI (via a wireframe, screenshot, or real-world app), and is then asked to explain how they would build it within the context of a real project.</p>

<p>Depending on the candidate’s experience level, role, (and level of interview stress), this can be run as an open-ended conversation driven by the candidate directly, or as a series of guided themes / questions.</p>

<p>The whole exercise takes 30min to 1h depending on what is covered – spend a good 5 mins on the problem statement + intro &amp; architecture, then move through the themes.</p>

<p>I really like this because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It makes for a more conversational interview – even if the questions are fixed, it’s more natural to have them with a specific app to think about.</li>
  <li>For candidates, it makes it easier to relate to their past work, for example reflecting on similar apps they’ve built.</li>
  <li>For interviewers, it does give enough structure to the interview that candidates’ answers can easily be categorised on the fly, and then compared to those of other candidates.</li>
</ul>

<p>This works particularly well if the wireframe has quite a few things going on visually, with different types of data, a user account, and a form or two.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following from <a href="/accessibility-audits-getting-started">Accessibility audits: getting started</a>, here are practical tips on how to procure / schedule an accessibility audit, and how to structure the report.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Accessibility audits can take anywhere from 10 minutes to a week, depending on the scope of the audit, the amount of manual testing required, and the expected report format.</p>

<p>The main factors for an estimate are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What’s the purpose of the audit? Do we want a “compliant = yes/no”, or create a backlog of improvements, or something in-between</li>
  <li>What’s the scope? How many sites / page types / pages. Provide links to a few pages so we have a sense of how many issues we’re likely to find (the more, the longer it takes to report them).</li>
  <li>What kind of report / output do they need? Either something for stakeholders, or developers, or both. Generally it takes nearly as much time to write the report as to find the issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>Avoid compliance pass/fail audits, which are onerous, and for which we aren’t competent. Get in touch with <a href="https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/">DAC</a>, <a href="https://www.rnib.org.uk/rnib-business">RNIB</a>, <a href="https://abilitynet.org.uk/accessibility-services/products-and-services">AbilityNet</a>, or <a href="https://www.deque.com/">Deque</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Suggested format for medium websites</strong>: “backlog of improvements”, for which we can make a proposal for 1 to 4 days, based on automated tests, manual tests for 5 to 10 page types. A one-pager “executive summary” report, and adjoining list of issues / backlog as a spreadsheet or Trello board.</p>

<h2 id="audit-strategy">Audit strategy</h2>

<h3 id="target-standards">Target standards</h3>

<p>First, define the target standard for the audit. Generally WCAG 2.1 AA, or Section 508. We will consider the latest Section 508 version, post January 2018 update to track WCAG2.0 AA.</p>

<p>If relevant, also define which standards are out of scope, such as compliance for the Rehabilitation Act and ADA. Compliance for WCAG2.1 AAA is out of scope, but we may provide AAA issues as relevant if they seem to be easily solvable.</p>

<h3 id="audit-scope">Audit scope</h3>

<p>Make a clear list of URLs to audit. Define whether the audit is on a production or staging environment. If there is any dynamic functionality to audit, define to what extent.</p>

<h3 id="report-format">Report format</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Keep it actionable. We don’t want to do pass/fail compliance audits.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>“Cover sheet” / written document with overview of common issues, and a scoring of how feasible it seems to reach compliance &amp; effort involved.</li>
  <li>Tabular data / spreadsheet with individual issues at a more granular level. Including testing tool if relevant, &amp; proposed solution if time allows.</li>
  <li>As relevant, direct output from automated / semi-automated testing tools</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="high-level-testing-methodology">High-level testing methodology</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>See <a href="/accessibility-audits-getting-started">Accessibility audits: getting started</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a baseline only, please adapt as needed. For all identified pages,</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bulk automated page checks with <a href="https://validator.github.io/validator/">V.Nu HTML5 validator</a></li>
  <li>Bulk automated page checks with <a href="https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y">Pa11y</a> – HTML CodeSniffer, Axe.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a relevant subset of pages,</p>

<ul>
  <li>Single-page semi-automated checks with either <a href="https://accessibilityinsights.io/">Accessibility Insights</a> or similar.</li>
  <li>Manual keyboard navigation checks</li>
  <li>Manual colour contrast check for non-text UI elements and images</li>
  <li>Manual screen reader navigation check with VoiceOver in macOS Safari</li>
  <li>Manual zoom &amp; magnification testing with Chrome &amp; macOS Zoom</li>
</ul>

<p>For a smaller subset of high-value pages,</p>

<ul>
  <li>Full screen reader testing with VoiceOver in macOS Safari</li>
  <li>Full screen reader testing with NVDA in Firefox ESR</li>
  <li>Full screen reader testing with VoiceOver in iOS Safari</li>
  <li>Mobile touch interaction testing with iOS Safari</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="outcome-of-the-audit">Outcome of the audit</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Report to project stakeholders</li>
  <li>Guidance for implementers</li>
  <li>Report to other vendors if needed</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Curlylint now has a website! 🎉</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>While the linter itself is still very experimental, and subject to major changes, I believe that having great documentation is a much more important step than any single feature or linting rule of the linter. Particularly:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Documenting the rules, with their respective configuration options, with lots of examples.</li>
  <li>Documenting CLI options, and (hopefully) future editor integrations.</li>
</ul>

<p>With a standalone site (as opposed to Markdown files in GitHub), I can create clean URLs for each of the rules, that can then be used directly in the CLI’s output. This is all inspired by <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a>, which is years ahead of any other static analysis tool I’ve ever used.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/welcome-to-curlylint/eslint-awesome.gif" alt="Screen capture of ESLint in VS Code, with link to a rule’s documentation, and options to automatically disable the rule" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ESLint’s VS Code integration, with link straight to the rule’s documentation, and options to auto-disable the violation.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-website">The website</h2>

<p>The website itself is built with <a href="https://v2.docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus v2</a>. I don’t think this matters too much – the main features I was after were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A focus on documentation websites – with versioning, code highlighting.</li>
  <li>Being able to write docs in Markdown without having to worry about creating a theme, or manually writing HTML / CSS.</li>
  <li>Having a blog section and blogging features directly on the same docs website.</li>
</ul>

<p>The fact that it’s built with React is a plus that will come in handy should I want to build more bespoke pages. MDX is a plus too.</p>

<h2 id="up-next">Up next</h2>

<p>Once the website is up and running, there are two things I’d really like to make:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An editor integration with VS Code. I’ve had some exposure to this with <a href="https://github.com/stylelint/vscode-stylelint">vscode-stylelint</a>, but still don’t have the clearest understanding of how best to do this for a Python CLI.</li>
  <li>An online playground similar to that of <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a>. I think it’s the best demonstrator of a tool’s capabilities, and it simplifies bug reports / quick tests greatly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Onwards!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ever heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack">timing attacks</a>? Turns out timing attack vulnerabilities are pretty common. It’s unclear to me how practical those attacks are, but I wouldn’t risk it.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="finding-timing-attack-vulnerabilities">Finding timing attack vulnerabilities</h2>

<p>The gist of a timing attack is an <em><a href="http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/208.html">observable timing discrepancy</a></em> in access control code:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some code compares two values in order to determine whether something is authorised or not, for example comparing the user input with a stored plaintext password, or even comparing a hashed version of the user input against a password hash.</li>
  <li>Turns out, the programming language executing that comparison is smart enough to stop the comparison as early as one of the characters stops matching – instead of having to compare all of the characters of the two strings.</li>
  <li>If the execution time of the comparison can be observed – then an attacker can determine whether their supplied input is getting closer to the compared value, by seeing the execution take gradually longer.</li>
</ul>

<p>What does this look like in practice? This:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you know what to look for, timing attack vulnerabilities really are everywhere. In <a href="https://github.com/flawyte/now-basic-auth/issues/4">basic auth code</a>. In <a href="https://github.com/tm-kn/django-basic-auth-ip-whitelist/security/advisories/GHSA-m38j-pmg3-v5x5">more basic auth code</a>, and also in <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/security/advisories/GHSA-jjjr-3jcw-f8v6">password-protected content</a>.</p>

<p>For me, this came up because I was looking for a good Express basic auth implementation, stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/LionC/express-basic-auth">express-basic-auth</a>, which works well, and then wondered – “oh, are other libraries using a <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_timingsafeequal_a_b">timing-safe comparison function</a>?” Lots weren’t.</p>

<h2 id="protecting-yourself">Protecting yourself</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, all sensitive comparison checks should use timing-safe comparison functions such as Node’s <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_timingsafeequal_a_b">crypto.timingSafeEqual</a> or Python 3.4+’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/hmac.html#hmac.compare_digest">hmac.compare_digest</a> (or Django’s <a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/659a73bc0a2df9be856e23fcfc6cc66d0d1a35fd/django/utils/crypto.py#L77"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">crypto.constant_time_compare</code></a>).</p>

<h3 id="proactively-looking-for-similar-issues">Proactively looking for similar issues</h3>

<p>You will want to look for all access control code that uses the programming language’s built-in comparison operators (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">==</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!=</code>). I’m very excited about the potential of platforms like <a href="https://lgtm.com/">LGTM</a> and their <a href="https://securitylab.github.com/tools/codeql">CodeQL language</a> to find vulnerabilities like this automaticaly. Here is a sample query:</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">import</span> <span class="nx">python</span>

<span class="k">from</span> <span class="nx">Compare</span> <span class="nx">eq</span>

<span class="nx">select</span> <span class="nx">eq</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a relatively naive query, but it helped me identify issues like Wagtail’s bypass-able <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/6127">image serve signature check</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to try this out for yourself, <a href="https://securitylab.github.com/tools/codeql">GitHub’s Security Labs</a> have the most extensive documentation on how to use this.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Accessibility audits can be daunting to get started with. Here are my recipes to deliver accessibility audits for web projects, combining multiple layers of automation with manual testing to get the best of both worlds.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="auditing-strategy">Auditing strategy</h2>

<p>First, determine what standard to audit for. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag">WCAG 2.1 AA</a> is generally a good start, as the standard that underlines many countries’ regulations. Don’t stop at any given standard though – the goal of an audit really is to identify improvements, rather than compliance box ticking.</p>

<p>With this in mind, start with automated tools to find as many issues as possible. Then, we can dedicate more time to more thorough manual testing of specific pages or components.</p>

<p>As a developer, I like the audit to be based on tools that can be used in automated test suites. Continuous integration capabilities are a big plus too, making it much easier for the site to keep being tested consistently after the auditing work is over.</p>

<h2 id="accessibility-audits-for-beginners">Accessibility audits for beginners</h2>

<p>It’s worth pointing out early – while some parts of my approach are very beginner-friendly – others rely on years of experience with accessibility guidelines and usability best practices. If you don’t know where to start, here are the easiest first steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you’re familiar with command-line tools and want something quick, grab <a href="https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y">Pa11y</a> and point it at pages.</li>
  <li>If you want to analyse a page more thoroughly, use <a href="https://accessibilityinsights.io/">Accessibility Insights</a>.</li>
  <li>If you have money, get <a href="https://www.powermapper.com/products/sortsite/">SortSite</a> or <a href="https://tenon.io/">Tenon</a>. I haven’t used these myself, those recommendations are only based on the invaluable <a href="https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-tool-audit/">GDS accessibility tools audit</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/blog/accessibility-audits-getting-started/accessibility-insights-tab-stops.png" alt="Screenshot of Accessibility Insights tab stops" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Accessibility Insights’ tab stops tool is invaluable to identify strange tab orders, and optimise keyboard navigation</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="intermediate-level-auditing">Intermediate-level auditing</h2>

<h3 id="source-code-analysis">Source code analysis</h3>

<p>If possible, this is always a valuable first step. Identifying issues directly in the code will make them much easier to fix, and improves your chances of finding issues that might not be identifiable during manual testing because they rely on a specific state of the app or site.</p>

<p>Linters are very useful here:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react">eslint-plugin-react</a>, <a href="https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y">eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y</a> for React, which has the most advanced static analysis tools of any front-end stack.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/thibaudcolas/curlylint">curlylint</a> for HTML templates, my (experimental! 💥) attempt at bridging that gap.</li>
</ul>

<p>I also audit code manually, by searching the project’s source. Here are common patterns I search for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Usage of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">role</code> attribute. It’s very easy to misuse – roles that don’t exist, that need specific parents or children, that are redundant with the element’s intrinsic role. Roles that have no practical impact without further ARIA attributes (most commonly labels, or state).</li>
  <li>Usage of ARIA attributes. They are also <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#no_aria_better_bad_aria">easy to misuse</a>.</li>
  <li>Tables markup. Tables need a caption, and headers that define their scope.</li>
  <li>Button markup. Misusing anchor tags for buttons.</li>
  <li>Forms markup. Making sure they use the correct native controls, with sensible attributes.</li>
  <li>Tabs, menus, dropdowns, toggles. It’s quick to check whether they have any kind of keyboard navigation implemented, and whether they have the correct ARIA attributes set for any given state.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bulk-page-checks">Bulk page checks</h3>

<p>After looking at the source, the next step is to look at pages in “bulk” mode – running automated tools that scan as much of the site as possible. My preference is for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://validator.github.io/validator/">V.Nu HTML5 validator</a>. Either the Docker image, or the pre-compiled CLI binaries, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vnu &lt;url&gt;</code>. Generally I will either do this for the whole sitemap, or a subset of URLs.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y-ci">pa11y-ci</a>, or Pa11y directly, for the whole sitemap or a subset of URLs if there is a need for further automation. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pa11y-ci --config &lt;my config&gt; --sitemap &lt;project sitemap&gt; --json &gt; sitemap-report.json</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pa11y is worth a special mention here. Pa11y is a wrapper of <a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core">Axe</a> and <a href="https://github.com/squizlabs/HTML_CodeSniffer">HTML_CodeSniffer</a>, which do the actual accessibility checks. It allows those tools to be run in bulk mode, over many pages, or at different states of a page by interacting with it automatically.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/accessibility-audits-getting-started/pa11y-ci-sitemap-mode.png" alt="Screenshot of pa11y-ci output in sitemap mode" /></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Here is a basic configuration file, summarising how I tend to use it:</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">urls</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
  <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="p">};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="single-page-checks">Single-page checks</h3>

<p>Now let’s look at intermediate techniques to apply per page. Depending on the site’s size, number of different page types, and budget for the audit, I would generally apply those checks on a sample of between five to ten page types. First,</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y">Pa11y</a>, if not already used in CI mode. Make sure it runs both HTML_CodeSniffer and Axe.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://accessibilityinsights.io/">Accessibility Insights</a> extension from Microsoft, with its FastPass mode, which also uses Axe under the hood.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then in the browser, there are a lot of semi-automated tests worth doing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>With Accessibility Insights – use the colour, heading, landmark tools to quickly visualise the page structure and spot issues.</li>
  <li>With a screen reader’s navigation (e.g. <a href="https://accessibility.psu.edu/screenreaders/voiceover/">VoiceOver Rotor</a>), inspect all of the page’s landmarks, headings, images, tables, frames, form elements, links and buttons.</li>
</ul>

<p>Only about <a href="https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-tool-audit/">30 to 40%</a> of accessibility issues can be found with fully automated tools, so these semi-automated checks are a great way to go beyond that, without having to spend hours manually navigating pages.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/accessibility-audits-getting-started/voiceover-rotor-safari.png" alt="Screenshot of the VoiceOver Rotor, in Safari, show a list of landmarks for a site’s homepage. Some landmarks have custom labels." /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The VoiceOver rotor is a very convenient way to get started with screen reader testing for beginners.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="manual-testing-for-high-value-pages">Manual testing for high-value pages</h3>

<p>Manual tests are the most time-consuming and require the most expertise. We want to navigate the site site in the same way a user of assistive technology would, focusing on parts of the experience that automated tests cannot assess. I generally advise to try the following:</p>

<h4 id="zoom-level">Zoom level</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Is the whole page usable with 200% to 400% page-level zoom?</li>
  <li>Does the site support browsers’ font resizing features?</li>
  <li>Are there any issues when using an on-screen magnifier?</li>
  <li>Are there areas of the site that require bidirectional scrolling because of the zoom level?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="colour">Colour</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Are there any non-text UI elements for which the contrast is too low?</li>
  <li>Any :focus or other active states that are reliant on colour alone, or too low contrast?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="keyboard-navigation">Keyboard navigation</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Can the whole page be used with a keyboard only?</li>
  <li>Are there <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation-trapping.html">keyboard traps</a>?</li>
  <li>Are there parts of the page where focus should be trapped but isn’t?</li>
  <li>Are the tab stops logical?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="screen-reader-navigation">Screen reader navigation</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Can the whole page be navigated with a screen reader?</li>
  <li>Are there relevant things on the page that aren’t being announced?</li>
  <li>Or things that shouldn’t be announced? E.g. decorative images, or repetitive text.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="pointer-touch-and-click-navigation">Pointer (touch and click) navigation</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Are pointer targets big enough, and not too close to one another?</li>
  <li>Are there areas of the page that are hard to scroll (especially on mobile)?</li>
  <li>Are there areas on the page that require horizontal scrolling (especially on mobile)?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This barely scratches the surface</strong>, especially when it comes to screen reader usage. Test with <a href="https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/contributing/developing.html#accessibility-targets">multiple screen readers</a> if possible – my go-tos being VoiceOver with Safari on macOS &amp; iOS, and NVDA with Firefox on Windows.</p>

<h2 id="expert-level-accessibility-compliance-testing">Expert-level accessibility compliance testing</h2>

<p>All of the above is great in order to make a website accessible, but to assess compliance with standards, you need to know the actual standards, and test for each of the compliance criteria. For WCAG 2.1, I recommend to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Know all of the WCAG2.1 A, AA, AAA success criteria – refer to the <a href="https://alphagov.github.io/wcag-primer/all.html#common-mistakes">GOV.UK WCAG 2.1 Primer</a> for a “cheatsheet” version.</li>
  <li>For each commonly-used component, know which success criteria are relevant – refer to the official <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/">WCAG2.1 quick reference</a>.</li>
  <li>Know about established <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/">ARIA practices</a>, and their respective browser support</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’re ready, dive through Accessibility Insights’ <a href="https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/en/web/getstarted/assessment">Assessment tool</a>, which is by far the most advanced freely available accessibility compliance testing tool there is.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-audits">Beyond audits</h2>

<p>Congratulations, you’re now equipped to audit websites! Make the most of those skills to identify improvements on the sites you build and use – but keep in mind that no single audit can deliver ongoing, sustainable accessibility.</p>

<p>Going beyond audits, it’s worth investing into training to create accessible experiences as a default. Also look into opportunities to have accessibility be part of your normal process – whether that’s by having <a href="https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/a11y">tests in your UI library</a> as a developer, or <a href="https://github.com/neon-jungle/wagtail-accessibility">accessibility features in the CMS</a> as an editor. More on that in a future post!</p>

    <updated>2020-04-20T22:03:29+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://thib.me/conventions-to-organize-react-projects</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve spent a lot of time thinking of how best to structure React projects over the last few years. This is especially important when React is a central part of the project’s front-end tech stack, as React in itself has very few opinions about how to organize code (it’s a library, not a framework). Here are my notes.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>

<p>My favourite file structure is that of <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>. In particular,</p>

<ul>
  <li>At the top level, dividing code by functional area</li>
  <li>Within each functional area, the files’ names follow an established convention based on non-functional considerations.</li>
  <li>If needed, code can then be broken up by functional area for each type of file</li>
</ul>

<p>What I really like about those conventions is that they give the code as much room to grow as possible – add more apps as the project grows, remove whole apps if they’re no longer needed, and sub-divide individual apps if they start getting too big.</p>

<p>Here is what this looks like in practice:</p>

<pre><code class="language-txt">demo
├── feedback
│   ├── templates
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── views.py
├── polls
│   ├── admin.py
│   ├── migrations
│   ├── models
│   │   ├── questions.py
│   │   └── choices.py
│   ├── templates
│   │   └── polls
│   │       ├── question_list.html
│   │       └── results.html
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── views.py
├── settings.py
└── urls.py
</code></pre>

<ol>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">polls</code> is a functional area</li>
  <li>Within this, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">urls.py</code> does all routing-level logic for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">polls</code></li>
  <li>If needed, that non-functional can be broken up into further features-oriented files like with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">models</code>, which has separate files.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-overarching-rules">The overarching rules</h2>

<p>From that Django baseline, here are rules I like to follow when adapting this to arbitrary technologies.</p>

<h3 id="folder-structure">Folder structure</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Co-locate code by feature rather than file type as much as possible.
    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Button.js</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Button.css</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Button.test.js</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Button.md</code> should all live side-by-side.</li>
      <li>User profile logic, avatar &amp; bio UI components, profile details update forms – should all be close one-another if possible.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Avoid files that are just importing and re-exporting code.
    <ul>
      <li>These are useful for libraries that need a clean API, and an overhead for our first-party project code.</li>
      <li>Modern IDEs support automatically updating file paths as files move, and auto-completing imports.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Extract code that is not feature-specific into a reusable “shared” folder.</li>
  <li>Consider having another “modules” folder for code that is so un-specific to your project that it could just as well come from a dependency.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="naming-conventions">Naming conventions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Files should be named after their default export as much as possible.
    <ul>
      <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Button</code> component lives in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Button.js</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For ancilliary files, take the name of the main file and suffix it with the “type”.
    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Button.test.js</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Button.stories.js</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Button.scss</code></li>
      <li>Files that represent non-functional considerations can be named after the “app” they are in, for example <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">polls.models.js</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Each file name must be unique for the whole project, and convey what the file contains without context.
    <ul>
      <li>Don’t <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">models.js</code>. Do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">polls.models.js</code>. Don’t <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">urls.js</code>. Do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">polls.urls.js</code>.</li>
      <li>I always use text search and filters to navigate through code, this makes it much easier.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="import">Import</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Always import by relative file path.
    <ul>
      <li>Those imports are compatible with the most tools – IDEs, linters, SCMs</li>
      <li>They can be automatically generated by IDEs.</li>
      <li>They are very short when code is co-located with its immediate dependencies, which is the most common type of import.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="react-specificites">React specificites</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Components should be in their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">components</code> folder for each app</li>
  <li>If your tools allow it, always start by co-locating the component’s code, documentation, styles, data dependencies, all in the same file.
    <ul>
      <li>Break it down into separate co-located files if it gets too big.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Components should have their own folder if the component is made up of more than one file (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Button.js</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Button.test.js</code>)</li>
  <li>If React is your main UI building block, consider having a separate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pages</code> folder for page-level components, if the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">components</code> folder gets too big.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="redux-specificities">Redux specificities</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Follow the Ducks methodology, ideally using <a href="https://redux-starter-kit.js.org/">Redux Toolkit</a>.</li>
  <li>Co-locate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">connect</code> code in the component’s source. No one wants to jump back and forth between “container” and “dumb” components.</li>
</ul>
